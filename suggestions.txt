Potential Improvements:

1. Persistent Reminders (Database)
Currently reminders are lost if the bot restarts. Use SQLite or PostgreSQL to store them. - Need to look at Cloudflare database options.

2. Environment Variable Validation
No error handling if .env variables are missing or invalid - bot will crash on startup.

3. Fetch Archived Threads
Duplicate check only looks at active threads - users can create new threads if old ones are archived.

4. Rate Limit Handling
Adding many users to a thread could hit Discord's rate limits without proper handling.

5. Logging Improvements
 console timestamps
 log levels (info/warning/error)
 file logging for debugging

6. Better Thread Management
No way to list all open threads
No auto-close for inactive threads
No /reopen command

7. User Feedback
No confirmation when thread is created successfully (just ephemeral message that disappears).

8. Security
Token is loaded but not validated
No checks if bot has required permissions before attempting operations
9. Code Organization
All code in one file - would benefit from separating commands, utilities, and config.

10. Better Error Messages
Generic error messages don't help users understand what went wrong.

11. /close - supposed to close thread, but error in terminal and Discord, stating: Failed to Recieve Message, nothing existings. - Needs to remove everyone from thread that do not have the Recruiter or Director roles within Discord.

12. /remind - Command runs, but nothing happens.
